A stack is in itself a fairly simple construction that allows values to be
pushed to an popped from an allocated memory region. Stack elements are stored
and retrieved by the Last In, First Out principle.

\subsubsection{Stack elements}

Each element on a stack holds information about both the \textit{declared} and
\textit{actual} type of data that it contains. Details on this is described in
\ref{NEEDED}. The data is a simple array of bytes, stored in big endian order,
i.e. the most significant bit is at the lowest memory address.

\subsubsection{Memory Layout}

Arguably the most intuitive way to construct a stack is to use a simple array of
a fixed initial size and handle operations by keeping track of the number of
elements in the stack. A push operation thus increments the number of elements
and assigns a value to the new top-most slot. A pop operation will
correspondingly decrement the number of elements in the stack and potentially
return the element that is being removed. When the number of elements in the
stack exceeds the initial size of the containing array more memory must be
allocated. This can be done simply by use of \code{realloc} where the common
approach is to double the amount of allocated memory, to adapt to quickly
growing stacks. However, \code{realloc} can be a performance issue because it
will create a new allocation, copy over the current data and free the old
allocation\cite{man-realloc} which arguably is an expensive operation. Since the
stack is by far the most frequently used means of operation in \thename{} it is
critical that it performs well.

Another important thing to consider is that the content of a stack element
depends on the type of the element, and thus have varying sizes. An element
whose type is \code{Int8} requires a single byte for storage while an element of
type \code{Int32} requires 4 bytes of storage. Since we do not want to waste
memory on redundant bytes, that prevents us from implementing stack elements as
fixed size structures laid out in an array as described above. We have solved
the problem by implementing stack elements as a singly linked list going from
the top element down to the bottom. The memory used by the stack should be
contiguous, to avoid a large amount of allocations and deallocations, thus the
elements in the linked list must all reside one after another in memory. The
actual content of an element is stored \textit{in between} the linked list
nodes, and the \code{next} pointer simply points to the memory address following
its content data bytes (if there is another element following
it). Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:stack-layout} shows how the stack elements
are laid out.

\end{figure}

The C language does not support variable length arrays, which means that an
array must have its length declared, otherwise the type is regarded as
incomplete. However, line~\ref{code:stack-element:flexible-data} in
Listing~\ref{lst:implementation:stack:element} shows feature known as
\code{flexible array} that allows the last field of a struct to be declared as a
size-less array. We take advantage of exactly that so that we can easily
interpret the \code{data} field of an element as an array of bytes.

What is left to solve is the problem of a stack growing beyond its initial
size. As mentioned, reallocation of the memory used by the stack works, but
results in poor performance. To mitigate the issue we have modelled the stack as
a linked list of allocated memory regions which we call \textit{segments}. Each
segment is essentially a stack in itself and is implemented exactly as described
above. The benefit is that when a segment becomes full, a new segment is simply
allocated and wired into the linked list, thus preventing the need for a
reallocation. The exposed interface of the stack consists of a set of stack
operation functions that essentially maps operations onto segments by selecting
the appropriate segment, and potentially what index of its elements that will be
the target of a given operation. Thus the segments are hidden in the
implementation and are solely internal data structures which users need not know
of.

\begin{remark}
  Segmented stacks is not a novel idea. They are used by the Go programming
  language to facilitate large amounts of unbounded stacks (for so-called
  goroutines). The Rust programming language did as well but later abandoned
  them. There are arguments for not using them because of the overhead generated
  by extra work needed when stack limits are
  exceeded\cite{rust:segmented-stack, go:segmented-stack}.
\end{remark}

Segments are implemented as a doubly linked list as shown in
listing~\ref{lst:implementation:stack:segment}. Each segment keeps track of its
length (i.e.~number of elements current in the segment) and the top element. The
\code{content} field is the region allocated for storage of elements. The
\code{data\_cursor} is maintained to always point to the byte following the top
element's content bytes and is useful when pushing a new element. The
\code{size} field simply represents the size of the memory region allocated for
the segment and is used to check whether the segment has room for more elements.

A segment has a limited amount of space for elements but the stack itself is
unbounded as a result of the segment list; there is no limit to how many
segments can be allocated, except the amount of physical or virtual memory
available to the machine.

%TODO: what can be that big? arrays?
Stack elements can be arbitrarily large. For instance fixed size arrays stored
on the stack will be as large as need be, and might be bigger than the defined
segment size. Thus, before pushing an element (as shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:implementation:stack:operations}) we check whether the element
can fit into a segment, and if not a segment is allocated with the size
explicitly given. The new segment is allocated the required size for the element
plus the default segment size as to allow for more elements to be pushed and
minimize the segment handling overhead.

\subsubsection{Optimizing Memory Footprint}

A new segment is allocated when the last active segment becomes full, but is not
immediately freed when it becomes empty. Instead a number of segments are cached
to facilitate series of stack operations that operate right between the limit of
two segments. Consider a loop of code that repeatedly pushes four elements to
the stack only to pop them off moments after. If there are two slots left in the
last segment when the loop begins, a new segment must be allocated during the
course of one loop iteration. However when the iteration pops the values off
again the new segment will become empty, which without the cached segments would
result in the segment being freed. With the cached segments the newly allocated
segment is saved and is simply rewired into the stack when it is needed again.
% TODO: this could be further optimized by detecting such loops and
% increasing the size of the current segment. aint nobody got time for
% that.

When there are more inactive segments than defined by
\code{STACK\_NUM\_CACHED\_SEGMENTS} a segment will be freed. This is trivial
because all of the segments and its elements' data lies within the region
pointed to by \code{content}, so it is simply freed.

\subsubsection{Operations}

Stack operations are implemented as functions with a \code{stack\_} prefix and
their first parameter is a pointer to the stack on which the operation is to be
performed. To give sense of how it works in practice,
Listing~\ref{lst:implementation:stack:operations} shows the source code for the
\code{push} operation.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[ANSI]C},
  caption={Source code of the \code{push} stack operation},
  label={lst:implementation:stack:operations}]
void stack_push(stack *s, stack_element *se)
{
    if (se->actual_type->size > STACK_SEGMENT_SIZE) {
        stack_push_sized_segment(s, type->size + STACK_SEGMENT_SIZE);
    }
    else if (stack_will_overflow(s, se)) { (*@\label{code:stack-push:will-overflow}@*)
        stack_segment *old_seg = s->last_segment;
        se->next = old_seg->head; (*@\label{code:stack-push:link-segments}@*)

        stack_push_segment(s);
    }

    stack_segment_push_element(s->last_segment, se);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Line~\ref{code:stack-push:will-overflow} makes sure that there is room for the
stack element in the current segment. If there is not a new segment is created
and the \code{next} pointer of the new element is linked to the last element of
the previous segment so that the elements are in principle a single linked
list. The element is then pushed onto the segment.
