\subsection{Paradigm Support}

% good for dynamic
%% composite types are dynamic
Functional and dynamic languages

The groundwork is there, can primitives be used to make support?

\subsection{Performance Analysis}

\subsubsection{Micro Benchmarking}

Heap objects (w/ fields)

Sub-routines

Boxing

General use (stack, algorithms)

Recursion

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Comparison with Existing Systems}

``Indentical'' programs in JVM, CIL

Tables, graphs

\subsubsection{Memory Footprint}

\subsubsection{Optimizations}

Memory (valgrind)

Speed (gprof)

Maybe gcov

Sample of optimization: measure, pinpoint, patch, measure, profit

What are the bottle necks

Are the architectural issues

\subsection{Code Analysis}
\subsubsection{Code size (SLOC)}
\subsubsection{Architectural analysis}
\subsubsection{Readability, maintainability}
\subsubsection{Tests, coverage}
\subsubsection{Configurability (macros)}
