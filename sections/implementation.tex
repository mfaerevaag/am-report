\subsection{Tools and Languages}

We have implemented \thename{} in the C programming language, more specifically
using the C99 standard with GNU extensions by use of GCC\footnote{The GNU
  Compiler Collection: \url{https://gcc.gnu.org}}. There are both pros and cons
of using a relatively low-level language (as compared to other available
languages), but we found that the benefits outweighed the disadvantages.

First of all C is extremely portable; GCC is available on \textit{a lot} of
architectures, and all modern operating systems ship with a C compiler which
essentially is all that is required to build \thename{} for a new platform. The
standard libraries and architecture specific functions available differ with
each machine and device, so we aim at relying on as few external libraries as
possible and provide wrappers for the ones we use so that the implementation can
be ported quickly.

Secondly we do not want to rely on a garbage collector provided by languages
like C++ and Java. We need to full control over where each bit of data is
stored, mostly for performance reasons both in terms of memory footprint and
execution speed.

Third, speed is of the essence and C is notoriously fast, given that the code is
written in a good manner.

There are however downsides to using C. Because we are not veterans of C and due
to its low-level nature it is inherently more complex to develop features that
could be implemented in a few lines of code in a high-level language. Memory has
to be tracked meticulously to prevent memory leaks. We have found that it is a
great exercise for becoming proficient with programming in general because it
provides us with knowledge of the mechanisms that lie behind concepts that are
generally taken for granted.

For debugging we use gdb via GNU Emacs\footnote{GNU Emacs:
  \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs}} and for analyzing memory usage and
fixing memory leaks we use the Valgrind instrumentation tool\footnote{Valgrind:
  \url{http://valgrind.org}}.

The code is extensively documented using Doxygen\footnote{Doxygen:
  \url{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen}} style comments.

\textbf{Note:} The code snippets presented in the following sections does not
always correspond directly with the code found in the actual
implementation. They carry the gist of what we want to communicate but generally
avoids unnecessary and redundant information not relevant to the individual
cases.

\subsection{Core Infrastructure}

The infrastructure of \thename{} is the code that lays the basis for interaction
between the individual parts of the system. It is a collection of machinery
which hand control back and forth between each other, such as the instruction
cycle, thread management and exception handling. Besides the machine's exposed
exception handling system there is an internal error handling mechanism which
allows errors within the machine to be handled as gracefully.

\subsubsection{Instruction Cycle}

The fundamental means of operation in the machine is the execution of
instructions parsed and interpreted from byte code. Each thread runs their own
cycle, the essence of which is shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:implementation:instruction-cycle}

\begin{lstlisting}[%
  caption={Pseudo representation of the instruction cycle},%

}

\subsection{Threading}
% Abstraction
% Structure (tree)
%% Main thread

To support concurrent programming fundamental mechanisms of threading has to be
supported. These include creating and destroying threads while also having
synchronization structures for mutual exclusion, such as mutexes.

We have done this by wrapping existing implementations of threading libraries.
This way we can easily change the threading back-end by choosing which library
wrapper to be compiled with the executable. The interface for threads will
therefor be the same, regardless of which library is handling the logic.

The thread interface is defines in {\tt thread.h}, while the back-ends will live
in {\tt thread\_<lib>.c}.

The abstract machine itself utilizes threading by always running programs
through threads. That way, all errors will safely be handled without crashing
the main process. This is paramount, as machine crashes are considered critical
errors and should never occur.

Threads will be structured in a tree fashion, where a thread can spawn multiple
child threads.
% TODO: update
\begin{ccode}
struct thread_state {
    struct thread_state *parent;
    struct thread_state *children;

    void *thread;

    uint32_t pc;
    stack_t stack;

    ...
};
\end{ccode}

As shown above, each thread state has a void pointer called {\tt thread}
(TODO). This is used by the chosen threading library, where itself needs to
create the necessary structures and track the data. This will likely consist of
some internal thread identifier and possible mutex variables.

\subsection{Testing}

% Test-Driven Development (not strictly)
% unit tests
% black box testing
% def. terms

Throughout the project we have made heavy use of testing to ensure the
correctness of the implementation, i.e. whether it strictly follows the machine
specification~\ref{sec:spec}. We have both made use of \term{unit}- and
\term{integration-tests}. Here unit-tests have the purpose of testing a single
isolated component, typically a function. Here we mock a specific state of the
machine, or the state of a component in the machine, and then run isolated
functions where we {\it know} what the result should be, for which we can easily
test. By comparison, the integration-tests have a much larger scope. Their
purpose is to test the whole program without any regard to any specific
component. This effectively ensures each component is wired together correctly.

For parts of the implementation we have made use of \term{test-driven
  development} (TDD). Here we write the tests prior to implementing the actual
functionality being tested. This eliminates the danger of false positives, where
tests pass when they are not supposed to. It also offers an efficient work flow,
where the minimum functionality is implemented to make the tests pass.

\subsubsection{Unit-tests}
Unit-testing in C is a fairly simple process and essentially does not require
any framework or library. While not required, a simple set of \term{macros} will
greatly improve the readability and ease of writing tests.

% cmocka
In spite of this, we have chosen to use a unit-testing library called {\it
  cmocka}~\cite{cmocka}. It is a well tested and documented library, also used
by large projects like {\it libssh}~\footnote{Implementation of the SSH protocol:
  \url{http://libssh.org/}}. It offers several features which makes unit-testing
more powerful and simpler to write. For instance, it offers test suites and
\term{mocking} of objects which enabled us to set up a specific state of the
machine. With this state, we can run isolated tests, manipulating the state and
thereafter checking that the correct transformations and output has occurred.

Cmocka also allows the test program to recover from signaled exceptions,
e.g. {\tt SIGSEGV}, {\tt SIGILL}, etc. If a test in the test program triggers a
segmentation fault exception, for instance, it will not exit, but rather show
where the exception occurred and print useful debugging information like the
call stack.

Lastly, the library works on a wide range of platform and only requires the use
of the C library. This makes it possible to use the library on embedded
platforms and with different compilers.

% example
As an example, we will describe how we test parts of the stack implementation.

Firstly, we create a mocked state of a stack which we can use for our tests.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[ANSI]C},caption={Unit-test setup procedure}]
  static int setup(void **state)
  {
    stack_t *s = malloc(sizeof(stack_t));
    stack_init(s, 100);

    assert_non_null(s->elements);
    assert_int_equal(100, s->max_size);
    assert_int_equal(0, sum_stack(s));

    *state = s;

    return 0;
  }
\end{lstlisting}

In the above code listing, we initialize a stack object, do some
simple assertions, and store it in the {\tt state} variable passed
with the setup function. As we see below, this state is given as
argument to all test cases which easily allows us to retrieve it by
dereferencing.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[ANSI]C},caption={Unit-test of {\tt stack\_pop}}]
  static void test_pop(void **state)
  {
    stack_t *s = *state;

    uint32_t sum = sum_stack(s);

    stack_push(s, make_se_int(1));
    stack_push(s, make_se_int(2));
    stack_push(s, make_se_int(3));

    assert_int_equal(3, SE_INT(stack_pop(s)));
    assert_int_equal(2, SE_INT(stack_pop(s)));
    assert_int_equal(1, SE_INT(stack_pop(s)));

    assert_int_equal(sum, sum_stack(s));
  }
\end{lstlisting}

After having retrieved the stack for the {\tt state} parameter, we create an XOR
sum of the stack. When having tested the specific function, we assert that the
new XOR sum is the same as before, making sure that there is no unexpected
changes to the stack. Due to the simple nature of our {\tt stack\_sum} function,
this is not a guarantee, as different states of the stack may compute the same
sum. % TODO: more on stack sum?
In the body of our test case, the {\tt stack\_pop} function in this case, we
push several elements to the stack and assert that they are popped off again in
the correct order.

After all test cases has completed, a teardown function is run, reversing that
of the setup function. In the case of the stack tests, it simply frees the
memory allocated to the state of the stack.
% \begin{lstlisting}[language={[ANSI]C},caption={Unit-test teardown procedure}]
%   static int teardown(void **state)
%   {
%   stack_t *s = *state;
%   stack_free(s);
%
%   return 0;
% }
% \end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Integration-tests}
We want our integration tests to test the implementation in the fashion of
black-box testing, i.e. given some input, the program should produce a specific
output, regardless of how the program works internally. The easiest way of
accomplishing this is by taking the actual machine executable and running it
with certain programs and arguments. We have therefor created several different
programs, from which we know the desired output.

As an example we can check that the machine fails when stack underflow occurs,
i.e. popping more values off the stack then there are actual values. A program
doing exactly this could be:
% TODO: update with actual
\begin{lstlisting}[language={bytecode},caption={Machine program producing
    stack underflow}]
  fn main
  {
    pop
  }
\end{lstlisting}

The above machine program will try to pop an element off the stack without there
being any elements, producing a stack underflow error. We can test the output of
the machine by both asserting the exit code of the process, where we will have
specified the meanings of different exit codes, and by asserting what is written
to standard out and error ({\tt stdout} and {\tt stderr}). In the case of stack
underflow the exit code should be 4 and the output should match `underflow`
(TODO: update).

To automate this process we use shell scripting. For convenience, we have chosen
to utilize a shell testing framework (that's right), called {\tt
  shUnit2}~\footnote{shUnit2, unit testing for shell scripts:
  \url{http://code.google.com/p/shunit2/}}. This lets us streamline the
integration testing process, in contrast of manually running each machine
program and checking the output.

shUnit2 enables us to have an alias for the actual machine binary, letting us
set the target binary through our build system and piping standard error to
standard out. In our test cases we can then, by using the alias, store the
output and exit code in variables and do assertions based on their expected
values.
% TODO: update return code
\begin{lstlisting}[language={sh},caption={shUnit2 underflow test case}]
  test_stack_underflow()
  {
    output=$(am --file ${PDIR}/underflow.amb)
    ret=$?

    assertEquals "return code should be 4" 4 $ret
    assertTrue "output should include underflow" \
    "contains \"$output\" \"underflow\""
  }
\end{lstlisting}

In the above test case we run the machine with the underflow program, asserting
that the process exits with the correct code and that the output contains the
word `underflow`.
