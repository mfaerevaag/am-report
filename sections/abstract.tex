Abstract machines are used everywhere that code is to be executed, be it web
browsers, desktop applications or embedded devices. The industry standard
abstract machines available today are predominantly designed with imperative and
object-oriented languages in mind, often resulting in awkward ad-hoc
implementations for trending paradigms like functional and dynamic
languages. This thesis presents an attempt to design and implement a new
abstract machine called \thename{} whose ambition is to efficiently and
elegantly support both traditional and emerging paradigms. We describe the
instruction set supported by \thename{} and detail how the implementation was
developed. Finally we present a performance and architectural analysis which
indicates that while \thename{} is not on par with industry standards, it has
potential to fulfill its vision. The result is a working abstract machine that
is capable of executing simple programs in an elegant and flexible manner.
