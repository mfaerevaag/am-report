Recent trends show that programming language paradigms, such as functional and
dynamic, are becoming increasingly popular. Today's industry standard abstract
machines was originally designed without regard to other paradigms than one
specific. This makes them lack the flexibility to properly handle languages of
different paradigms. Current implementations offer ad-hoc solutions for fitting
other paradigms into theirs, but as they do not fit into the fundamental design,
the issues can never be properly be addressed. This thesis outlines the reasons
for current implementation not being properly able to handle modern language
paradigms, while also doing a serious effort in designing a new abstract from
scratch, solving said challenges. This abstract machine will effectively
supporting all modern language paradigms. The major challenges of this task
being the design. How to make the machine low-level enough to handle all
paradigms, while keeping the language expressive enough for being a convenient
compilation target.
