Recent trends show that programming language paradigms, such as functional and
dynamic, are becoming increasingly popular. Today's most most popular abstract
machines has originally been designed prior to this trend and are in many ways
not properly fit for handling such paradigms. Current implementations offer
ad-hoc solutions for fitting other paradigms into their, but as the fundamental
design does not support them, the issues can never be properly addressed. This
thesis outlines the reasons for current implementation not being properly able
to handle modern language paradigms, while also does a serious effort in
designing a new abstract from scratch, solving said challenges, effectively
supporting all modern language paradigms. The major challenges being, how to
design such a machine while also keeping the language expressive.
