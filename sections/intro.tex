% Motivation

Abstract machines are used in all possible scenarios where executable code is to
be executed. They are used in web browsers, smart cards, IDEs and even
compilers, to name a few. The current abstract machines, like the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) or Microsoft's Common Language Runtime (CLR), are heavily focused
on a sub-set of languages, primarily object-oriented. Although one can get by
with `hacking` a program written in an unsupported language, into an
object-oriented model, it is neither an efficient or eloquent solution.


\subsection{The problem}

% Problem statements
The main goals of this project is to provide a generic abstract machine which
can handle a multitude of programming languages and programming paradigms, for
instance traditional programming paradigms such as object orientation and
functional programming as well as emerging paradigms such as dynamic
languages. With this we want to provide low enough primitives for system
programming, yet and by default provide a secure high-level programming
environment.

This involves:
\begin{itemize}
\item Defining an instruction set which can handle a wide range of paradigms
\item Defining an execution model which can support the aforementioned paradigms
\item Implementing an interpreter supporting the instruction set and the execution model
\item Evaluating the performance of the interpreter
\end{itemize}

% Brief results
The result is awesome (TODO).


\subsection{Structure of the report}

In this report we will start with laying the ground works of knowledge and
concepts by describing the background of abstract machines and multi-paradigm
designs. Thereafter we will describe our design and it's implementation. Lastly
we will evaluate the result, while also discussing related work and the
management of the project.
